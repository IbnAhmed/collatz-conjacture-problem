# What is "collatz conjacture"?
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns sequences defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

## Simple Equation
Odd = 3n+1

Even = n/2

## What I did?
I built a program, which takes a integer number and return all the sequence by applying collactz conjacture. It also shows the visual represention of the sequences.

## What I used for develpment?
